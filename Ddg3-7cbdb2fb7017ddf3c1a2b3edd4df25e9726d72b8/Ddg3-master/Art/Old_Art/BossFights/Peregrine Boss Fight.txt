Peregrine Boss Fight:

Entrance: 
Boss throws V-patterns and lines of bird-bullets at player
Repeats until player does enough damage

Second Phase: 

4 turrets rise from the ground

Each turret is commanded by a bird; the turrets are firing at the player

(V- attacks/lines continue)

The player(s) must shoot the bird off of the turret, allowing them to command it

The turret(s) being commanded must fire at both wings

(Excess turrets deal extra damage)

Damage Phase:

All attacks stop and turrets fall back into the ground

The boss is stunned for 20 seconds, allowing for damage output

Third Phase:

Falcon swoops through the stage and takes the player to an empty location

An X of birds swoops horizontally through a random y-position

The boss swoops down on a random x-position at the shown y-position

If the player shoots the bosses head during this swoop,
new birds will swoop down and this repeats 3 times
at which point the next damage phase begins
if the boss is missed, players take damage and it swoops down again

Damage Phase 2:

Damage until dead
